# Youtube-Playlist-Statistics
A repo which has functions to calculate stats of a youtube playlist like total duration, average duration etc.

In addition, it also lets you compare two playlists and tell you the intersection set of the 2 sets. This was my main intent towards writing this repository. I have been maintaining two playlists for many years, for a single purpose. After many years of their creation, I wanted to check if they have started diverging or not. I usually relevant added videos to both of them but I found out that there were some 10-15 mismatches now, accumulated in a perid of 4-5 years.
