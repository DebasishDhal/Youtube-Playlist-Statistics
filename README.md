In addition, given two playlists as input, it will telly you which videos belong only to one of the playlists. This was my original goal when I started with this repository. I have been maintaining two playlists for many years, the two playlists are meant for the same task. Whenever I find a relevant video, I add to both the playlist. But I wanted to find out if over the years if these playlists have started diverging. This function worked well, and I found that out of ~250 videos, some 10-15 videos were present in only one of the playlists. 

More features might be added in future.
